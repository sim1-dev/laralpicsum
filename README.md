$pic->setGrayScale(1);
$pic->setBlur(4);
$pic->setSeed("i4Opv540Z3wq");
$pic->setFormat('webp');
return $pic->base64();


//Get image URL

$pic = new Larapicsum(400, 600, 1, 4, "webp", "test");
return $pic->url(); //"https://picsum.photos/seed/test/400/600?grayscale=1&blur=4.webp"

return new Larapicsum(); //{"width":300,"height":200,"grayscale":0,"blur":0,"format":"jpeg","seed":"","url":"https://picsum.photos/300/200?grayscale=0&blur=0.jpeg"}

```


## Larapicsum Object Properties

- string Seed - The seed of your image, using a specific seed will ensure you to always get the same image
- string Format - The format/extension of your image (default: "jpeg")
- number Width - The width of your image (px)
- number Height - The height of your image (px)
- number Grayscale (0/1) - Enables/Disables Grayscale for your image (API also supports higher numbers, but as now they don't differ at all from grayscale = 1)
- number Blur (0/10) - The amount of blur of your image (amount*10%, example: blur = 4, final blur amount = 40%)
